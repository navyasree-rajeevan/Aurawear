### Project Description
"This project is a web application that helps users choose the most suitable dress based on their skin tone, event type, and provided dress descriptions. Utilizing Python Flask and the Gemini API, it intelligently selects the best dress for the user."

### The Problem statement
"The challenge is to develop a web application that seamlessly integrates user inputs‚Äîskin tone, event type, and dress descriptions‚Äî to recommend the most suitable dress using the Gemini API. The goal is to create an intelligent system that enhances user experience by accurately selecting the best dress for each unique combination of inputs."

### The Solution
Develop a web application using Python Flask for the backend and HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend. Integrate the Gemini API to analyze user inputs‚Äîskin tone, event type, and dress descriptions‚Äîand recommend the most suitable dress. Display the selected dress on the results page for the user.
