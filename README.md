### Project Description
"This project is a web application that helps users choose the most suitable dress based on their skin tone, event type, and provided dress descriptions. Utilizing Python Flask and the Gemini API, it intelligently selects the best dress for the user."

### The Problem statement
"The challenge is to develop a web application that seamlessly integrates user inputs‚Äîskin tone, event type, and dress descriptions‚Äî to recommend the most suitable dress using the Gemini API. The goal is to create an intelligent system that enhances user experience by accurately selecting the best dress for each unique combination of inputs."

### The Solution
Develop a web application using Python Flask for the backend and HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend. Integrate the Gemini API to analyze user inputs‚Äîskin tone, event type, and dress descriptions‚Äîand recommend the most suitable dress. Display the selected dress on the results page for the user.

            (Result Display to User)

Frontend (Client): The user interacts with various pages, including the Home Page, Skin Tone Selector, Event Chooser, Dress Page, and Result Page. The frontend collects user inputs and communicates with the backend.

Backend (Flask): The Flask backend handles routes for selecting skin tone, choosing events, and submitting dress descriptions. It processes user inputs, calls the Gemini API, and returns the recommended dress to the frontend.

User Interaction:

Home Page: The user starts here.

Skin Tone Selector: The user selects their skin tone.

Event Chooser: The user chooses the event.

Dress Page: The user uploads dress descriptions.

Result Page: The user sees the recommended dress.

Backend (Flask):

/select_skin_tone: Handles skin tone selection.

/select_event: Handles event selection.

/submit_dress_description: Processes dress descriptions and calls Gemini API.

Call Gemini API: Communicates with the Gemini API for recommendations.

Process API Response: Processes the response from the API and sends it back to the frontend.

Gemini API:

Gemini API Endpoint: The external API that provides the dress recommendation

Frontend (Client): The user navigates through the Home Page, Skin Tone Selector, Event Chooser, Dress Page, and Result Page.

Backend (Flask): The Flask backend routes handle the selection of skin tone, event, and submission of dress descriptions, and it calls the Gemini API.

Gemini API (External): The backend sends data to the Gemini API, which processes the request and returns the recommended dress.

User: The recommended dress is displayed to the user on the Result Page.
